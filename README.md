### Task: Fetch data (advanced)

API Url:
- Details URL: https://mate-academy.github.io/phone-catalogue-static/api/phones/:phoneId.json

The main goal of this task is an advanced using of Promises.

Create next functions:
- `getFirstReceivedDetails` which takes array of phone's ID and `resolves` with the first received detail (the fastest response NOT the first in the list). Ignore the other responses;
- `getAllSuccessfulDetails` which takes array of phones' IDs and `resolves` with an array of all successfully received details (errors should be ignored).

(optional) `getThreeFastestDetails` which takes array of phones IDs and `resolves` with an array of the details for the first 3 responses (the fastest).

Hints: 
- You have to use DOM to notify users about resolved or rejected promises; 
- Create <div> elements with classes `first-received` and `all-successful` which contain list of phones;
- Each <div> element should have <h3> headings with `First Received` or `All Successful` text;
- All IDs and names of phones should be inside of  <li> elements.
